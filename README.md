# WordJump-Serious-Games-Project
Serious Games module project for my final year at NTU
VESVET is an EU initiative to encourage entrepreneurial learning in higher education: This project was built in collaborating with tutors and VESVET representatives that gave feedback to encourage development of a game to meet educational criteria.

# How to Play

## 1. The Questions

First you'll need an input file of formatted questions and answers, you can find an example one [HERE](https://pastebin.com/fJ5bFy90) which you can use to make your own.

You'll need at least 4 different questions and answers to get the most from this game; the more the merrier!

When you select "load new questions" you'll launch a file explorer that can be used to locate a valid .txt file. The game does a very simple parse check to ensure that the data is valid for gameplay, and you'll then be able to select "Play" once the file is loaded!

## 2. Gameplay

The premise is simple: jump between platforms like you're playing doodlejump. The time will deplete over time; so collect coins to progress further!

Collecting coins opens up this interface. Select the correct answer to the question prompt to get additional time and score! Wrong answers _deplete_ your score, so be careful! Also make sure to answer quickly because there's a time limit here too!

Falling off the screen or running out of time will lead to you losing.

## 3. Multi-language options

If English isn't your first language, WordJump implements the *Unity Engine Localization* package that allows for easy development of alternative translations. Currently, only Welsh, German, and English are present, but I'll be happy to merge any pull requests with new translations!
